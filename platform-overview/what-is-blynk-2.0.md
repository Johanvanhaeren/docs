Blynk is a full suite of software required to prototype, deploy, and remotely manage connected electronic devices at any scale: from personal IoT projects to millions of commercial connected products. 

With Blynk anyone can connect their hardware to the cloud and build no-code iOS, Android, and web applications to analyze real-time and historical data coming from devices, control them from anywhere in the world, receive important alerts, and much much moreâ€¦

Blynk is a [multi-tenant](multi-tenant-tree-structure.md) solution. You can configure how users get access to the data by setting roles and configuring permissions.

Applications made with Blynk are ready for the end-users. Whether this is your family member, employee, or someone who has purchased your product, they will be able to download the app, connect the device and start using it. 

Blynk is a white-label solution, which means that you can add your company logo, app icon, and publish the app to App Store and Google Play under your company name. These apps will work with your devices.
