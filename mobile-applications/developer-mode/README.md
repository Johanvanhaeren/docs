### Tile Types

There are 6 Devices tiles presets with different actions applied on tap : 

* **Default** – views selected Datastream value in the tile \(e.g.: temperature, volume, percentage, etc.\)
* **Icon Button** – tap on the Device Tile will trigger an action or switch ON/OFF state
* **Icon Level** – displays proportional level \(brightness, power, etc.\) based on selected Datastream value
* **Color Brightness** – allows to view and edit Color, Power status and Brightness level of the Device
* **Image** – shows Icon/Image on the Tile. No quick actions. It can be used for recognition purpose. 
* **3 Labels** – it's a hybrid of Default and Icon Button. Up to 3 Datastream values display is supported
