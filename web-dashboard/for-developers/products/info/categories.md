Use this option to group devices by their type on voice assistants \(Alexa, Google Assistant\) side. It allows you to control the entire group of devices by giving single commands.

**Examples:**

1. voice command "Alexa, lights on" turns on all the bulbs in the room â€“ you don't have to repeat the command for each of them;
2. voice command "Alexa, play the music" starts playing the music from the nearest or all the speakers \(depending on assistants presets\).

Choose the corresponding device type\(s\) from the dropdown menu.
