# Virtual Pin

Virtual Pin is a concept invented to provide exchange of any data between hardware, web and mobile app. Virtual pins allow you to interface with any sensor, any library, any actuator.

Think about Virtual Pins as a box where you can put any value, and everyone who has access to this box can see this value.  
You can set **UNITS** that will be viewed in the Widget by selecting them from the dropdown menu.

It's a very powerful feature to display and send any data from your hardware to the application.

Please make sure you differentiate Virtual Pins from physical GPIO pins on your hardware.
