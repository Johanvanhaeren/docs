# Max Value

![](../../../../../.gitbook/assets/max.gif)

`max` field is used in order to avoid unexpected values within the Datastream. For every value that matches the data stream type and larger than `max` - `max` will value be used.

For example, you set the `max` value as `10` for your `Integer` data stream and hardware sends `11`. In that case `10` value will be used instead of `11`. The same rule applies for HTTPS API and any user input on the web or mobile application.
