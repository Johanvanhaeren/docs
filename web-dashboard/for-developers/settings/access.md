## Roles and Permissions

![](../../../.gitbook/assets/roles_and_perms.gif)



Blynk has 3 roles that can have different permissions sets: 

* **Admin** – supposed to have maximum permissions set
* **Staff** – we recommend to set up and use this role for user support processes such as handling user invitation, device check and debug, view and assist users' organizations
* **Users** – supposed to have least permissions set that is focued mostly on managing user's own devices.

### Actions

* **Collapse/Expand all** in Actions block – applies eponymous actions to expandable permissions list
* **+ / -** buttons – click to expand/collapse specific permissions sections
* **Enable/Disable** switches – click switches accordingly to access/permissions you want to grant/prohibit to specific users types. Note that some permissions are connected with other.
